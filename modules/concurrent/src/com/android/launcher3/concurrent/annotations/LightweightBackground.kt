 * This is a lightweight executor that is suitable for running cheap background

 * [LightweightBackgroundPriority] flag.
 *
 * LighweightBackground is distinct from Background in that it will not pollute
 * the other as to ensure responsiveness of either.
 *
 * Non priority usecases include:
 * - Data transformations within repository layers
 *
 * Priority usecases include:
 * - Responses to user interactions
 *
 * Tasks submitted to this executor are guaranteed to be ordered.
 *
 * @param priority The priority of the lightweight background executor. By
 * default, this is [LightweightBackgroundPriority.DATA].
